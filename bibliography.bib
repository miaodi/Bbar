There is no other book on this topic.??? ???Ren?? de Borst, Eindhoven University of Technology Written by leading experts in the field and featuring fully integrated colour throughout, Isogeometric Analysis provides a groundbreaking solution for the integration of {CAD} and {FEA} technologies. Tom Hughes and his researchers, Austin Cottrell and Yuri Bazilevs, present their pioneering isogeometric approach, which aims to integrate the two techniques of {CAD} and {FEA} using precise {NURBS} geometry in the {FEA} application. This technology offers the potential to revolutionise automobile, ship and airplane design and analysis by allowing models to be designed, tested and adjusted in one integrative stage. Providing a systematic approach to the topic, the authors begin with a tutorial introducing the foundations of Isogeometric Analysis, before advancing to a comprehensive coverage of the most recent developments in the technique. The authors offer a clear explanation as to how to add isogeometric capabilities to existing finite element computer programs, demonstrating how to implement and use the technology. Detailed programming examples and datasets are included to impart a thorough knowledge and understanding of the material.  Provides examples of different applications, showing the reader how to implement isogeometric models Addresses readers on both sides of the {CAD}/{FEA} divide Describes Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines ({NURBS}) basis functions},
